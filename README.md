# Fire-Hawk-Optimizer-for-MealPy
As part of Advanced Optimization Course during my Masters in Data Sciences and Business Analytics, me and my team contributed to the open-source package MealPy, which develops nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms in order to implement them on applications such as Deep Learning.

The objective of our deliverable was to create a class in MealPy that would be able to implement the algorithm proposed by the paper ”Fire Hawk Optimizer: a novel metaheuristic algorithm”. You can find more details in the report uploaded in this repository.

It is to be noted that the code produced by our group was submitted to the MealPy project. Our pull request was accepted, as the owner of the project was satisfied of our contribution. Here is the link: https://github.com/thieu1995/metaheuristics/pull/8.
